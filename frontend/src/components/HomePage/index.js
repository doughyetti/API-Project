          <h1>The People platform - Where interests become friendships</h1>
          <p>Meetup is a popular online platform designed to facilitate in-person group gatherings and events based on common interests. Meetup allows users to create or join groups centered around specific topics,
            hobbies, or activities. Members can connect with like-minded individuals, participate in discussions, and organize or attend real-life events and meetups in their local communities. The platform covers a wide range of interests,
            including sports, technology, arts, fitness, and more. Meetup aims to foster community engagement, social interaction, and the formation of meaningful relationships among people who share similar passions or goals. Participants can
            find and join meetups relevant to their interests, enabling them to network, learn new skills, or simply socialize with others who share their hobbies.</p>
